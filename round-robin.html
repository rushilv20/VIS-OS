    <h1 id="algo-title">Round-Robin</h1>
    <p>The name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin principle, where each person gets an equal share of something in turns. It is the oldest, simplest scheduling algorithm, which is mostly used for multitasking.<br>Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. This algorithm also offers starvation free execution of processes. </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle"><a id="2"></a>Characteristics of Round-Robin Scheduling</h3>
    <p>Here are the important characteristics of Round-Robin Scheduling:</p>
    <ul><li>Round robin is a pre-emptive algorithm</li><li>The CPU is shifted to the next process after fixed interval time, which is called time quantum/time slice. </li><li>The process that is preempted is added to the end of the queue.</li><li>Round robin is a hybrid model which is clock-driven </li><li>Time slice should be minimum, which is assigned for a specific task that needs to be processed. However, it may differ OS to OS.</li><li>It is a real time algorithm which responds to the event within a specific time limit.</li><li>Round robin is one of the oldest, fairest, and easiest algorithm.</li><li>Widely used scheduling method in traditional OS. </li></ul>

    <h3 class="subtitle"><a id="4"></a>Advantage of Round-robin Scheduling</h3>
    <p>Here, are pros/benefits of Round-robin scheduling method: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It doesn't face the issues of starvation or convoy effect.</li>
      <li>All the jobs get a fair allocation of CPU.</li>
      <li>It deals with all process without any priority </li>
      <li>If you know the total number of processes on the run queue, then you can also assume the worst-case response time for the same process.</li>
      <li>This scheduling method does not depend upon burst time. That's why it is easily implementable on the system. </li>
      <li>Once a process is executed for a specific set of the period, the process is preempted, and another process executes for that given time period.</li>
      <li>Allows OS to use the Context switching method to save states of preempted processes.</li>
      <li>It gives the best performance in terms of average response time. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="subtitle"><a id="5"></a>Disadvantages of Round-robin Scheduling</h3>
    <p>Here, are drawbacks/cons of using Round-robin scheduling: </p>
    <ul><li>If slicing time of OS is low, the processor output will be reduced. </li><li>This method spends more time on context switching</li><li>Its performance heavily depends on time quantum.</li><li>Priorities cannot be set for the processes.</li><li>Round-robin scheduling doesn't give special priority to more important tasks.</li><li>Decreases comprehension </li><li>Lower time quantum results in higher the context switching overhead in the system.</li><li>Finding a correct time quantum is a quite difficult task in this system.</li></ul>
